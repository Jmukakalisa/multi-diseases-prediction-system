It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.\n","\n","The key challenges against it’s detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous).\n","\n","**Acknowledgements:**\n","This dataset has been referred from Kaggle."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"H0rLXAGHewa6"},"source":["This colab contains the analysis of classifying these tumors using machine learning models such as logisticRegression and SVMs and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.\n","\n","**Objectives:**\n","\n","1.
